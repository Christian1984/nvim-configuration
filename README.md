# NEOVIM Configuration

This repo contains a history and current configuration of my nvim config.

Clone to `~/.config/nvim`

Configuration is heavily inspired by chris' repo https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch and his excellent tutorial https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhoH5vyxr6Qq41NFL4GvhFp-WLd5xzIzZ
